;; Created: 14 Septermber 2015
;; Version: 1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((flycheck "0.18"))

;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds support for mypy to flycheck.  To use it, add
;; to your init.el:

;; (require 'flycheck-mypy)
;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)

;; If you want to use mypy you probably don't want pylint or
;; flake8. To disable those checkers, add the following to your
;; init.el:

;; (add-to-list 'flycheck-disabled-checkers 'python-flake8)
;; (add-to-list 'flycheck-disabled-checkers 'python-pylint)
